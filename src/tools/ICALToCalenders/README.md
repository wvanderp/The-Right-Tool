# ICS to calenders

Many sites provide an ICS file to add something to our calendars. The problem with this is that our calendar apps (especially Google Calendar) do not support opening ICS files.

This tool reads the ICS files and provides a link to add them to Google Calender.

you "upload" the ICS file to this tool, and it will parse the file and provide a relevant link to add the event to your calendar.
